A very striking work of art. There is much speculation about its meaning. The rusty brown, mottled work of steel represents the 'Binding of Isaäc',
created by Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman. The work harks back to the biblical story of Abraham, who is commissioned to sacrifice his son Isaac.
At the last moment an angel manages to stop Abraham. A ram that has become entangled in the bush is then sacrificed.
Abraham, who did so much in the name of God, was put to the test.
