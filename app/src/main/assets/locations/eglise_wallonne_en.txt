The Walloon Church of Breda
This church was founded in 1440 by Johanna van Polanen and gifted to the beguines.
The original name of the church was the WendilinusChurch, this was because it was dedicated to the saint Wendilinus.
in 1590 the church was redecorated to become a protestant church but was given back to the beguines in 1625 by the Spanish.
When the Spanish were driven out of Breda in 1637 it was changed to a protestant church again and that is how it is till today.
currently, the church is available as a wedding location and there are still services on the second and fourth Sunday of the month at 11 o'clock.
