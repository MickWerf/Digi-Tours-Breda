The Grote Markt in Breda is the central square of Breda.
This square has been the core of Breda since the early Middle Ages.
In the Middle Ages, three inns were located on the Markt: Herberg de Beer, run by the sister of the bailiff of Zevenbergen, Herberg de Zwaan and Herberg de Wilderman.
Until 1898 there was a huge lime tree.
This was cut down in the coronation year of Queen Wilhelmina and made way for the Wilhelmina fountain that stood there for a decade.
In 1909 the fountain moved to its current location on Sophiaplein.
Until 1950, there was also a music kiosk on the Grote Markt, where music performances were given in the summer.
On the square is still the war memorial Judith with the head of Holofernes van Niel Steenbergen.
Nowadays you can eat at many cafes and restaurants on the main market, there are also many shops in turn.
