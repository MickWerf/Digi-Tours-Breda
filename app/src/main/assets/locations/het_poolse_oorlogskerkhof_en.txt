the polish war cemetery:
Polish soldiers from World War II fallen in the Netherlands are buried in this plot. They originally belonged to the units of the Polish army and air force that in September 1939, after the invasion of Poland by the German army, emigrated to France, where the Polish government had also sought refuge. After the capitulation of the French army in June 1940, the Polish soldiers again managed to escape German captivity. They managed to reach England via Spain and Gibraltar. There they formed, among others, the Polish First Armored Division under the command of Major General Stanislaw Maczek and the Polish First Independent Parachute Brigade.

After the landings in Normandy in June 1944, these Poles fought with the Allies for the liberation of Western Europe. In the Netherlands they competed in Zeelandic Flanders, West Brabant, in the battle of Arnhem and in Groningen and Drenthe. More than 500 fallen Polish soldiers and airmen found their final resting place in our country, 163 of them here in Breda, which was liberated by the First Polish Armored Division on October 29, 1944
