The statue known as saint juttemis is based on the biblical heroine Judith.
Judith has many stories to her name and it is not known which of these is true.
The statue was made by Nico van der Burgt and was placed for carnival in 1991.
A well-known saying for this statue is: 'wait until St. Juttemis'
This meant endless waiting.
