The Spanjaardsgat
The Spanjaardsgat is a water gate that is located in the turn of the harbor and lies between the grenade tower and the pigeon tower of castle Breda.
The water gate is named after the events with the peat ship of Breda.
This story is about the Dutch troops used a peat ship to get into the castle because the rest of the defenses were well controlled by the Spanish.
The water gate was a hole in the Spanish defenses that is why it was named Spanjaardsgat 20 years later after the conquest.
Today the water gate is still used for concerts, Sinterklaas and guided tours.
