17. Diagonally across the street on the Grote Markt you will find the town hall of Breda
and also the branch of the VVV.

The main entrance to the stand house is located above the guarded platform
is served by two sandstone lions. The town hall, as it looks now,
only came into being in 1767. There are actually four houses, which were then used by the
master builder of Orange, Philips Willem Schonck, behind one facade
hidden. The oldest part is the main hall. Already in the fifteenth century
in addition, a so-called 'Cleyn raedthuys' was also put into use. Came in 1898
the most right house, the 'Lying Deer' there, which is still a separate one
facade. has.

Despite the fact that the town hall has only limited opening for it
public, we want to give you the following information about the inside of it anyway
do not remember.
Lady Justice above the main entrance and the wooden statue at the back of the hall
indicate that in the past, justice was also administered in the town hall.
The counter of the former court, once standing against the back wall of the
hall, is now kept in the Breda's Museum.
On the left is a large copy of the famous painting by Velasques' Las
Lanzas ", that the surrender of Breda to the Spanish commander Spinola (1625)
pictures.
The original painting hangs in the Prado in Madrid.
The town hall is still used for public council meetings and for it
marriages. The mayor, councilors and government officials
houses since February 1992 in the new Municipal Offices on Claudius
Prinsenlaan in Breda. We walk through the gatehouse to the right of the town hall
the Stadserf. In the middle of this square, the statue reminds us of De
Peat skipper from Gerarda Rueb, to the legendary raid in 1590 from
Adriaan van Bergen with his Peat Ship. (The VVV Breda sells one of these
replica).
