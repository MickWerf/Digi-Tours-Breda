5. You immediately dive into the early history of
Breda, if you take the path right over the bridge
takes and continues through the city park, it
Valkenberg, walk.

Until 1812 this park served as a castle garden for the
Lords of Breda. The park takes its name from a fall-
Kenhuis, which stood on the edge of it and from which the
Castle residents and their guests practiced falconry.
The park was originally a real forest with tall trees.
That disappeared in the seventeenth century
character through the creation of a garden
to French style.
One replica of the 17 statues is standing
further down the park, in a special
landscaped flowerbed. This bed is one
reminder of the French style garden.
The original statue is on display
in the Breda's Museum.
In 1995 the Valkenberg is in a new one
jacket. There are trails throughout the park
relocated, shrubs and bushes removed
and new lighting installed. beside
new benches have been placed in the park and
made play facilities for the children. In excavations in
the park are the foundations of a medieval mhouse
and found from the stone wall, which until 1537 "little Breda"
surrounded. A small piece has been built up from two wall towers.
